# Minesweeper

The classic game is back, and now you don't have to worry about all of the shit where at the end you have to guess because the information needed to deduce where a mine is is simply not available and never will be.

Thanks to elaborate but not excessive constraint satisfaction modeling, now it just fixes the board to a nice one when you're in a position of really truly having to guess.

Also some other nice options, autoplay, showing the deductions on board.
